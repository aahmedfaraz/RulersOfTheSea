            <p>There are many things that define Karachi. Ask anyone they might say things such as: the food, the lights, and above all, they’ll speak of the vast body of water that touches the shores of the metropolitan area.</p>
            <p>However, what we call ‘samandar´ (sea view), and what the people of Karachi view as a place of leisure and fun, is actually home to the Karachi Fish Harbor, also known to locals as the Fishery.</p>
            <div class="imgCont">

            </div>
            <p>The Karachi Harbor is famous as the biggest of its kind in all of Pakistan, catering to a total of 75 percent of the local fleet being consumed in the city of lights. These numbers are a direct result of the wide variety of boats and experienced fishermen. These fishermen get to work way before the sun even reaches its peak rise, setting out their sails in search of their catch of the day.</p>
            <div class="imgCont">
                <img src="./Assets/images/fishery/2.jpg" alt="2">
                <small>Fishermen prepare their boats and gather supplies for a day of fishing out in the waters.</small>
            </div>
            <p>Rough hands that speak of years of experience, dark skin that shows the reality of working under the sun for 12+ hours and a face that is full of determination to earn a livelihood are a few words that can describe the fishermen at the harbor, who single-handedly carry the fishing industry on their backs.</p>
            <p>The job is not as easy as it may seem from the perspective of an outsider. What seems like a normal routine of setting out to sea and coming back with a caching net full of fishes, is actually hours of roaming the vast sea, net put out, only to collect a few fishes.</p>
            <div class="imgCont">

            </div>
            <p>However, at the end of the day, more often than not, the long hours spent fishing and boating under the sun are worth it as the fishermen return to port to drop off their catch of the day, ready to be distributed and sold to sellers.</p>

            <p>The fishes presented in the warehouse are bought by vendors and sellers in large quantities, often in the form of Styrofoam boxes.</p>

            </div>
            <p>After this purchasing process, the vendors then proceed to selling these fishes to the general public at their own rates.</p>

            </div>
            <p>While the fishermen, and the vendors are an important part of the fishing industry, there is another person who is responsible for protecting the fishes from a possible ‘fish-heist’, that may occur at any given moment: the security guard.</p>

            <p>“People think that my job here at the fishery is redundant, but they’d be shook to know how many thieves come in to pick up a fish or two for free!” Moazzam explained, while describing the importance of his job at the fishery.</p>
            <p>The fishermen are not just the rulers of the Karachi port though, beyond this port lies the famous Kemari. Most people know Kemari as the district that is part of Karachi, but to the fishermen, Kemari is no less than a fishing haven.</p>

            </div>
            <p>When it comes to Kemari, a saying that locals often say is, ‘there are more boats than water here.’ The statement sounds like a joke until one steps on to the actual port of Kemari, where there are nothing but entire fleets of boats, parked in disheveled rows of colorful sails and painted wood.</p>

            </div>
            <p>The fishermen at Kemari consider boats as their pride and joy. Often spending hours before they set out to sea to scrub and clean every nook and crevice of their boats.</p>

            </div>
            <p>While the Kemari and Karachi ports are home to professional fishermen, there lies an island that acts as a dividing barrier between the north and south of the Arabian Sea. This island is the famous Manora Island, more famous to the citizens of Karachi as Manora beach. </p>

                <small>Since locals usually sit near the edge, they are only able to catch smaller fishes.</small>
            </div>
            <p>For more professional fishing, locals of Manora island have purchased smaller boats fitted with ice boxes to capture and store fishes. These boats are made of iron as opposed to the wooden ones at Kemari. This is to combat the strong tidal waves.</p>

            <p>Manora Island is more than just fishing and boats. Beyond the pier and the port, is a temple meant for Hindu worshippers, and right next to the temple is a construction site, which may come as a surprise to anyone who views Manora as a simple island without any proper roads.</p>
